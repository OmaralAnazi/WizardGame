# Wizard Game

## Description
The "Wizard Game" is an interactive guided project from the Scrimba Front-End Developer Program. Players embody a wizard who battles against three monsters. Victory is achieved by defeating all adversaries, while defeat comes if the wizard's health is depleted first.

## Technologies

- CSS
- JavaScript

## Learnings
- Utilized object destructuring for cleaner and more readable code.
- Implemented array methods like `.map()`, `.forEach()`, `.reduce()`, and `.filter()` to manipulate game data.
- Managed game state and DOM updates using `setTimeout` for asynchronous events.
- Enhanced function composition by returning and calling functions within functions.
- Leveraged CSS for responsive design, including viewport units and flexbox order.
- Explored JavaScript's capabilities for creating dynamic interactions in a gaming context.
